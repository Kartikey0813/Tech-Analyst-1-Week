What is MongoDB? 
- MongoDB is a popular open-source, non-relational (NoSQL) database that stores data in a flexible, 
JSON-like format called BSON (Binary JSON). Unlike traditional relational databases that use tables and rows, 
MongoDB uses collections and documents, allowing for dynamic schemas and easy storage of complex, hierarchical data.

Key features:

Document-oriented: Data is stored as documents in collections, making it easy to represent real-world objects.
Schema-less: Collections do not require a fixed schema, so each document can have different fields.
Scalable: Supports horizontal scaling through sharding, making it suitable for large-scale applications.
High performance: Optimized for fast read and write operations.
Rich querying: Supports powerful queries, indexing, and aggregation.

Example Document:- 

{
  "name": "Kartikey Mishra",
  "email": "kartikey@gmail.com",
  "age": 25,
  "address": {
    "city": "Noida",
    "zip": "201301"
  }
}

Now how to install MongoDB Server. 

1. Go to this URL("https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community"). 

2. Download the ".tgz" file and extact it. 

3. Open the extracted file and then open the bin folder. 

4. Open the "mongod" file in terminal. 

5. click on the cammand- mongod --help. This helps us to get all the possible commands inside a directory. 

6. Now we need to change the data directory. This can be done by argument- --dbpath arg. 

7. Please make sure to have the db folder in the correct place. 

8. Now give this command "./mongod --dbpath Users/mongoServers/db". For your folder name it as .mongod --pbpath Users/"your file name"/db
