-------------------------- MongoDB --------------------------

What is MongoDB? 
- MongoDB is a popular open-source, non-relational (NoSQL) database that stores data in a flexible, 
JSON-like format called BSON (Binary JSON). Unlike traditional relational databases that use tables and rows, 
MongoDB uses collections and documents, allowing for dynamic schemas and easy storage of complex, hierarchical data.

Key features:

Document-oriented: Data is stored as documents in collections, making it easy to represent real-world objects.
Schema-less: Collections do not require a fixed schema, so each document can have different fields.
Scalable: Supports horizontal scaling through sharding, making it suitable for large-scale applications.
High performance: Optimized for fast read and write operations.
Rich querying: Supports powerful queries, indexing, and aggregation.

Example Document:- 

{
  "name": "Kartikey Mishra",
  "email": "kartikey@gmail.com",
  "age": 25,
  "address": {
    "city": "Noida",
    "zip": "201301"
  }
}
