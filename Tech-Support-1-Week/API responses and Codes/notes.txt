100 Continue: Request received, continue sending.

101 Switching Protocols: Server is switching protocols.


2xx: Success:- 

200 OK: Request succeeded; response contains requested data.
201 Created: Resource created successfully (e.g., after POST).
202 Accepted: Request accepted but not yet processed.
204 No Content: Request succeeded, no content to return.


3xx: Redirection:- 

301 Moved Permanently: Resource has moved to a new URL.
302 Found: Resource temporarily moved.
304 Not Modified: Resource not changed since last request.


4xx: Client Errors:- 


400 Bad Request: Request is malformed or invalid.
401 Unauthorized: Authentication required or failed.
403 Forbidden: Server refuses to fulfill the request.
404 Not Found: Resource not found.
405 Method Not Allowed: HTTP method not supported for resource.
409 Conflict: Request conflicts with current state of resource.
422 Unprocessable Entity: Request is well-formed but contains semantic errors.

5xx: Server Errors:- 

500 Internal Server Error: Generic server error.
501 Not Implemented: Server does not support the functionality.
502 Bad Gateway: Invalid response from upstream server.

504 Gateway Timeout: Upstream server failed to respond in time.


Common API Error Meanings:- 

400 Bad Request: Usually means missing or invalid parameters.

How to Handle API Errors

Read the error message: APIs often return a message or code in the response body.
Check documentation: API docs explain error codes and possible solutions.
Validate your request: Ensure all required fields and correct data types.
Retry if appropriate: For 5xx errors, sometimes retrying helps.
